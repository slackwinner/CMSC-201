# Description: This program asks the user about the state of 
#             two switches, and then use this information to
#             determine the state of the generator.

def main():
#   Grabs user input
    print("Please enter 'y' for yes and 'n' for no. ")
    switchInputOne = input("Is the first switch on? ")
    switchInputTwo = input("Is the second switch on? ")

#   Evaluates the switch inputs based on user`s response
    if switchInputOne == "y" and switchInputTwo == "n" or switchInputOne == "n" and switchInputTwo == "y":
       print("The generator is on")
    else:
        print("The generator is off")
