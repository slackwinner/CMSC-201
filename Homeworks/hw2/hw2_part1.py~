# Description: This program simulates a "procrastination reprimand" by asking 
#              the user how long they waited to start on the assignments for 
#              project 1. The user was given 6 days until the design is due, 
#              and 13 days until the project is due.

def main():
#   Grabs amount of days left for design and project phases from user.
    print("For project 1, you have 6 days to complete the design, and 13 days to complete the project.")
    designNum = int(input("Days left when you start the design: "))
    projectNum = int(input("Days left when you start the project: "))

#   This section evaluates the inputs and outputs an appropriate response.
#   Note: The elif section checks to see if designNum is equal to 6 days and
#         if projectNum is in between or equal to 10 and 13 days.
    if designNum == 0 or projectNum == 0:
       print("Why would you wait so long!? :(")
    elif designNum == 6:
         if projectNum >= 10 and projectNum <= 13:
            print("Wow, you started really early! Great job! :)")
    else:
        print("Good luck on the project! You can do it!")
#   Output below is used to space out results during exection of program.
    print(" ")
       
main()
