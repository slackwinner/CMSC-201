# Description: This program simulates the up and down
#              movement of a hailstone in a storm.

def main():

    # Grabs user input of starting height of the hailstone    
    startingHeight = int(input("Please enter the starting height of the hailstone: "))    

    # Loops through and outputs current heights until height is equal to o or 1
    while startingHeight > 0 and startingHeight != 1:
          print("Hail is currently at height ",int(startingHeight))
          #Calculates remainder of each startingHeight 
          modHeight = startingHeight % 2

          # If modHeight is 0 (i.e. startingHeight is even), divides by 2  
          if modHeight == 0:
             startingHeight =  startingHeight/2

          # If modHeight is 1 (i.e. startingHeight is odd), multiplies by 3 then adds 1
          elif modHeight == 1:
               startingHeight = startingHeight * 3
               startingHeight = startingHeight + 1
