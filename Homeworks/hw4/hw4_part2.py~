# Description: This program creates a custom symbol box based
#              on user`s input for the width, height, and
#              chosen symbols.

TOP_ROW = 1 #Beginning of box row
FIRST_INDEX = 0 #Beginning of first index
LAST_INDEX = 1 #Used to calculate the very last index in any given index length

def main():

    # Grabs user`s input prior to execution
    widthInput = int(input("Please enter the width of the box: "))
    heightInput = int(input("Please enter the height of the box: "))
    outsideSymbol = input("Please enter a symbol for the box outline: ")
    insideSymbol = input("Please enter a symbol for the box fill: ")
