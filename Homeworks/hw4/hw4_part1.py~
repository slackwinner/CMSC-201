def main():
    
    # Grabs user`s input prior to creating modulus table
    modInput = int(input("Please enter the number to mod by: "))
    maxAmount = int(input("Please enter how high you`d like to go: "))
    counter = 0

    # Performs mod division from 0 to maxAmount and outputs results 
    while counter <= maxAmount:
        modAnswer = counter % modInput
        print(counter," % ",modInput," = ",modAnswer)
        counter+=1
