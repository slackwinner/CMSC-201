# Description: This program draws a right triangle, recursively, based on 
#              the height and symbol the user provides.

# Represents the starting row value
S_ROW = 1

# Represents the starting width value
S_WIDTH = 0

# Used to increase numbers by given value 
INCREMENT = 1

###############################################################################
# recurTri() Outputs the right triangle symbol based on the 
#            user's inputs
# Input:     rowCounter; an integer that keeps track of the row level
#            widthCounter; an integer that tracks the length of the row level
#            height; an integer that represents how tall the right triangle is
#            symbol; a string that represents the character being used at each
#            row level
# Output:    None; Only serves as a print function and the return statements 
#            represents the recursive action
