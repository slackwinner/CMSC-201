# Description: This program asks the user for the number of words they want 
#              to enter, stores them in a list, and outputs them in the
#              reverse order.

FINAL_INDEX = 0 # Used to dentote final word index in reversed order
INDEX_FORMAT = 1 # Used to format length of lists and strings
INCREMENT_COUNTER = 1 # Used to increment any counter by specified number
