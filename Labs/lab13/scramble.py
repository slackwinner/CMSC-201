# permute() is a recursive function that scrambles a string
# Input:    currentScramble; the scrambled word so far
#           lettersLeft;     the letters left to scramble
# Output:   None;            prints out each scramble as it's completed
def permute(currentScramble, lettersLeft):

    # BASE CASE: __________
    if len(lettersLeft) == 0:
        # print out the ______ variable to see the result
        print(currentScramble)

    # RECURSIVE CASE: 
    else:
        # for each letter still available for scrambling
        for i in range(len(lettersLeft)):
            letter = lettersLeft[i]

            # create a copy of the string without that letter
            # (this code removes the FIRST instance of the letter)
            # (for example: if string was "2010", now it's "210")
            newLettersLeft = lettersLeft.replace(letter, "", 1)

            # add the letter we removed from lettersLeft
            # to the current scrambled word, call it newScramble
            newScramble = currentScramble + letter

            # RECURSIVE CALL: use the new variables for this call
            # permute() takes in currentScramble, lettersLeft
