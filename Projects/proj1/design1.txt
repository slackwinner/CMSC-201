# Description: This program allows a user to "load in" a database
# 	       of their choosing, and to either (1) search the database
#	       or (2) create a playlist of length 10 or less, based on 
#	       year, artist, or genre. 

# main menu options
USER_QUIT    = -1
MENU_SEARCH  = 0
MENU_CREATE  = 1

MIN_SONG_NUM = 0   # minimum number of songs in a playlist
MAX_SONG_NUM = 10  # maximum number of songs in a playlist

# these constants are used to give names to the columns of the 2D list
YEAR     = 0
ARTIST   = 1
TITLE    = 2
GENRE    = 3
DURATION = 4
TEMPO    = 5

# these constants are used to give names to the 2D playlist
PLAYLIST_YEAR = 1
PLAYLIST_ARTIST = 2
PLAYLIST_GENRE = 3

DETAIL_MIN = YEAR   # minimum value; used for getValidInput()
DETAIL_MAX = TEMPO  # maximum value

ROW_VALUE = YEAR    # Used to start at first row
COLUMN_VALUE = YEAR # Used to start at first column

PLAYLIST_MIN = ARTIST # minimum value; used for getValidInput()
PLAYLIST_MAX = GENRE  # maximum value; used for getValidInput()
